{-| Takes desired number of frames per second (fps). The resulting signal gives
   a sequence of time deltas as quickly as possible until it reaches the
   desired FPS. A time delta is the time between the last frame and the current
   frame. -}

{-| Same as the fps function, but you can turn it on and off. Allows you to do
   brief animations based on user input without major inefficiencies. The first
   time delta after a pause is always zero, no matter how long the pause was.
   This way summing the deltas will actually give the amount of time that the
   output signal has been running. -}
