import Helm.Graphics (Graphics)

-- | Represents a backend engine that can run a Helm game.
--
-- Helm separates the logic for running a game from the actual interaction with the user -
-- window management, event management (key presses, mouse presses, etc.) are all handled by a specific instance
-- of the engine typeclass. Meanwhile, the game loop and other core features are handled independently
-- by the Helm library itself.
class Engine e where
  -- | Renders a graphics element to the engine's game window.
  render :: e -> Graphics e -> IO ()

  -- | Ticks (or steps) the engine forward. Generally, an engine should use this method to
  -- gather any new input events from the underlying engine and sink them into the signals it provides below.
  -- Depending on the implementation of the engine, it might be necessary to do other things here too.
  tick :: e -> IO (Maybe e)

  -- | Cleans up all resources loaded by the engine. This will be run when the engine has stopped execution,
  -- hence it should do everything required to free any resources allocated by the engine.
  cleanup :: e -> IO ()

  -- | Get the game window size.
  windowSize :: e -> IO (V2 Int)

  -- | Get the current game running time.
  runningTime :: e -> IO Double

  -- | The mouse move signal, with events provided by the engine.
  mouseMoveSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [V2 Int])

  -- | The mouse down signal, with events provided by the engine.
  mouseDownSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [(MouseButton, V2 Int)])

  -- | The mouse up signal, with events provided by the engine.
  mouseUpSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [(MouseButton, V2 Int)])

  -- | The mouse click signal, with events provided by the engine.
  mouseClickSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [(MouseButton, V2 Int)])

  -- | The mouse wheel signal, with events provided by the engine.
  mouseWheelSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [V2 Int])

  -- | The keyboard down signal, with events provided by the engine.
  keyboardDownSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [Key])

  -- | The keyboard up signal, with events provided by the engine.
  keyboardUpSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [Key])

  -- | The keyboard press signal, with events provided by the engine.
  keyboardPressSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [Key])

  -- | The window resize signal, with events provided by the engine.
  windowResizeSignal :: e -> SignalGen e (Signal [V2 Int])

-- | Represents a subscription to a stream of events captured from a user's interaction with the engine.
-- A subscription is best thought of as a collection of events over time - which is the nature of
-- functional reactive programming (the paradigm that Helm bases its concepts on).
-- Although Helm uses a departed version of the traditional FRP paradigm, it still shares some
-- concepts. An understanding of FRP will allow you to understand the library easily.
--
-- Functions throughout the Helm library that return a subscription will first let you map the data
-- related to the event you're subscribing to into another form (specifically, a game action).
-- These game actions are then sent to the update function of your game, i.e. the mapped
-- subscription specifies exactly how game events will interact with your game state.
--
-- Here the type variable e is an instance of the 'Engine' typeclass
-- and the variable a is the game action data type used by your game.
newtype Sub e a = Sub (SignalGen e (Signal [a]))

-- | Represents an IO-like monad with knowledge about the state of the game engine. Each command
-- contains a collection of game actions that will be applied to your game's update function to update
-- the game state. This is similar to a subscription in a way, with the difference being that
-- a command does not change over time, but rather is a lazy monad and hence contains a value
-- from the time of the execution. A good example of the usage of a command vs. a subscription is the game
-- window size - a command would allow you to map the current window size into an action, whereas
-- a subscription would let you subscribe to when the window is resized and then map that event into
-- a game action.
--
-- Just like a subscription, any function that returns a command in the Helm library will
-- first let you map from the original contained value to a game action. It's important
-- to note that commands are **evaluated on the main-thread** - which means they can
-- block the rendering process. *Don't execute long-running monads under commands!*
--
-- Here the type variable e is an instance of the 'Engine' typeclass
-- and the variable a is the game action data type used by your game.
newtype Cmd e a = Cmd (StateT e IO [a])

-- | Represents the configuration for a Helm game.
--
-- The type variable e refers to an instance of the 'Engine' class,
-- m refers to a game model type and a refers to a game action type.
data GameLifecycle e m a = GameLifecycle {
  -- | Called when the game starts up. The first value in the tuple
  -- is the initial game model state and then the second value is an optional
  -- command to be run. The command allows you to execute some monads
  -- during game startup and build up some game actions before the game begins
  -- rendering. A good example would be loading a game configuration file,
  -- parsing the file contents and then mapping the parsed contents
  -- to relevant game actions.
  --
  -- If no initial command is required, simply pass 'Cmd.none'
  -- for the second tuple value. Alternatively, if there are a number of commands
  -- to run, call 'Cmd.batch' to combine them into one.
  initialFn :: (m, Cmd e a),

  -- | Called whenever a game action is mapped from a command or subscription.
  -- This is where the actual implementation of a Helm game is provided.
  -- The function is given a game model and an action,
  -- and should produce the new game model state based off of the action.
  --
  -- The first tuple value is the new model state, and then the second
  -- is a command that can be run to produce more game actions.
  -- By having this command returnable here, you can run additional IO logic
  -- based off the game action, and produce more game actions from the result.
  --
  -- Be very careful with what commands you run in the game update function - most importantly,
  -- don't execute long-winding commands or it will block the rendering process!.
  -- Helm will try to intelligently queue recursive commands to prevent blocking rendering.
  -- However, having a game action that returns a specific command from the update function,
  -- which in turn is executed and returns that same game action (which will then in turn return the same command,
  -- and so on) is not recommend. The best way to return commands from the update function is to
  -- to hide them behind conditionals based off your game state, so that they're not run every update function.
  updateFn :: m -> a -> (m, Cmd e a),

  -- | The subscriptions for a game. All the input sources required
  -- to make the game work should be subscribed to and mapped to the relevant
  -- game action type variant.
  --
  -- If no subscriptions are required (i.e. no user input is required),
  -- pass 'Sub.none'. Alternatively, if multiple subscriptions are required
  -- use 'Sub.batch' to combine them.
  subscriptionsFn :: Sub e a,

  -- | Called when the engine is ready to render the game.
  -- The function is given the current state of the game model
  -- and should produce a graphics value to be rendered to the
  -- screen.
  --
  -- Do not rely on this function being called every game tick -
  -- the engine will figure out whether it needs to be called
  -- based off window exposure and whether or not the game model
  -- has changed since the last render.
