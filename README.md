## Introduction

Helm is a functionally reactive game engine written in Haskell and built around
the [Elerea FRP framework](https://github.com/cobbpg/elerea). Helm is
heavily inspired by the [Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org) (especially the API).
All rendering is done through a vector-graphics based API. At the core, Helm is
built on SDL and the Cairo vector graphics library.

In Helm, every piece of input that can be gathered from a user (or the operating system)
is hidden behind a signal. For those unfamiliar with FRP, signals are essentially
a value that changes over time. This sort of architecture used for a game allows for pretty
simplistic (and in my opinion, artistic) code.

Documentation of the Helm API is available on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/helm).
There is currently a heavily work-in-progress guide on [Helm's website](http://helm-engine.org/guide),
which is a resource aiming to give thorough explanations of the way Helm and its API work through examples.
You can [ask on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/helm-dev) if you're having any trouble
with using the engine for games or working on the engine itself, or if you just want to chit-chat about
Helm.

## Features

* Allows you to express game logic dependent on input in a straightforward manner,
  treating events as first class values (the essence of FRP).
* Vector graphics based rendering, allow you to either write art
  designed for any resolution or still load generic images and render
  those as you would with any pixel-blitting engine.
* Straightforward API heavily inspired by the Elm programming language. The API
  is broken up into the following areas:
  * `FRP.Helm` contains the main code for interfacing with the game engine but
    also includes some utility functions and the modules `FRP.Helm.Color`, `FRP.Helm.Utilities`
    and `FRP.Helm.Graphics` in the style of a sort of prelude library, allowing it to be included
    and readily make the most basic of games.
  * `FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL.Color` contains the `Color` data structure, functions for composing
    colors and a few pre-defined colors that are usually used in games.
  * `FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL.Graphics` contains all the graphics data structures, functions
    for composing these structures and other general graphical utilities.
  * `FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL.Keyboard` contains signals for working with keyboard state.
  * `FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL.Mouse` contains signals for working with mouse state.
  * `FRP.Helm.Random` contains signals for generating random values
  * `FRP.Helm.Signal`  constains useful functions for working with signals such
     as lifting/folding
  * `FRP.Helm.Text` contains functions for composing text, formatting it
    and then turning it into an element.
  * `FRP.Helm.Time` contains functions for composing units of time and time-dependant signals
  * `FRP.Helm.Utilities` contains an assortment of useful functions,
  * `FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL.Window` contains signals for working with the game window state.

## Example

The simplest example of a Helm game that doesn't require any input from the user is the following:

```haskell
import FRP.Helm
import FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL
import qualified FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL.Window as Window

render :: (Int, Int) -> Element
render (w, h) = collage w h [move (100, 100) $ filled red $ square 64]

main :: IO ()
main = run defaultConfig $ render <~ Window.dimensions
```

It renders a red square at the position `(100, 100)` with a side length of `64`.

The next example is the barebones of a game that depends on input. It shows how to create
an accumulated state that depends on the values sampled from signals (e.g. mouse input).
You should see a white square on the screen and pressing the arrow keys allows you to move it.

```haskell
import FRP.Helm
import FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL
import qualified FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL.Keyboard as Keyboard
import qualified FRP.Helm.Backend.SDL.Window as Window

data State = State { mx :: Double, my :: Double }

step :: (Int, Int) -> State -> State
step (dx, dy) state = state { mx = (10 * (realToFrac dx)) + mx state,
                              my = (10 * (realToFrac dy)) + my state }

render :: (Int, Int) -> State -> Element
render (w, h) (State { mx = mx, my = my }) =
  centeredCollage w h [move (mx, my) $ filled white $ square 100]

main :: IO ()
main = run defaultConfig $ render <~ Window.dimensions ~~ stepper
  where
    state = State { mx = 0, my = 0 }
    stepper = foldp step state Keyboard.arrows
```

## Installing and Building

Helm requires GHC 7.6 (Elerea doesn't work with older versions due to a compiler bug).
To install the latest (stable) version from the Hackage repository, use:

```
cabal install helm
```

Alternatively to get the latest development version, you can clone this repository and then run:

```
cabal install
```

You may need to jump a few hoops to install the Cairo bindings (which are a dependency),
which unfortunately is out of my hands. Read the [installing guide](http://helm-engine.org/guide/installing/)
on the website for a few platform-specific instructions.

## License

Helm is licensed under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more details.

## Contributing

Helm would benefit from either of the following contributions:

1. Try out the engine, reporting any issues or suggestions you have.
2. Look through the source, get a feel for the code and then
   contribute some features or fixes. If you plan on contributing
   code please submit a pull request and follow the formatting
   styles set out in the current code: 2 space indents, documentation
   on every top-level function, favouring monad operators over
   do blocks when there is a logical flow of data, spaces between operators
   and after commas, etc. Please also confirm that the code passes under
   HLint.
